    "text": "Welcome\n\nOn this site, I present my empirical project, conducted as part of my Master’s thesis in Applied Economics and Data Science. In this project, I attempt to determine whether homebuyers in Denmark value energy efficiency and specific energy-related features in properties.\nIn particular, I explore whether homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for energy-efficient properties or, conversely, accept a discount for properties that are less energy-efficient. To quantify energy efficiency both the energy label or EPC label (i.e. the label stated in the Energy Performance Certificate of each property) and estimated energy consumption in kWh was utilized.\nFurthermore, the impact of different energy heat sources and three energy systems—specifically, properties with heat pumps, solar panels, and solar heating—on property prices was examined.\n\n\n\nKey languages/tools used\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Languages and their functions\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n Python\n R\n\n\n\n - Data cleaning and pre-processing\n\n - Data visualization\n\n\n\n - Web scraping\n\n - Regression modelling\n\n\n\n - PDF parsing (The EPC reports)\n\n\n\n\n\n - Text classification models (NLP)\n\n\n\n\n\n - Optical character recognition (OCR)\n\n\n\n\n\n - Geographical data extraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData and tool related to each function\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                \n                Web scraping\n            \n            \n                Data obtained\n                - Housing data: boliga.dk\n                - Enery Performance PDF files: boligejer.dk\n                Tools/Libraries\n                \n                 + Requests\n                 + Concurrent.futures\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                PDF parsing\n            \n            \n                Data used\n                - Enery Performance PDF files\n                Tools/Libraries\n                \n                 + pdfplumber\n                 + PyMuPDF\n                 + Regular expression operations\n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Text classification\n            \n            \n                Data used\n                - Specific text from the Enery Performance Certificates (PDF files)\n                Tools/Libraries\n                \n                 + Spacy\n                 + NLTK\n                 + Regular expression operations\n                 + Imblearn\n                 + sklearn\n                 + Gensim\n                 + Fasttext\n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Optical character recognition\n            \n            \n                Data used\n                - Specific Image from the Enery Performance Certificates (PDF files)\n                Tools/Libraries\n                \n                 + PyMuPDF\n                 + Pillow (PIL)\n                 + Pyhton wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine\n                 + Imblearn\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Geographical data extraction\n            \n            \n                Data used\n                - The property coordinates were obtained from web scraping boliga.dk\n                Tools/Libraries\n                \n                 + Valhalla - routing engine  (Docker version)\n                 + Geofabrik\n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Regression modelling\n            \n            \n                Data used\n                - The final dataset (harmonized, cleaned and ready to be used)\n                Tools/Libraries\n                \n                 + Fixest\n                 + Sandwich\n                 + Modelsummary",

    "text": "In the last decades, addressing the issue of climate change has become increasingly urgent. Governments worldwide have embarked on ambitious plans to lower carbon dioxide emissions and reduce energy consumption due to this heightened awareness. The European Union has established a long-term strategy to become a climate-neutral economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. With this plan, the EU aims to establish a crucial stepping stone for the world to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement by keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. This goal emphasized the urgent need for substantial economic change to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in high-emissions sectors. Among those sectors is the building industry, which is estimated to be responsible for 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions (Carlin 2022). About 70% of these emissions are generated by building operations, while construction activities contribute the remaining 30% (Carlin 2022). Regarding the European Union, the European Environment Agency (2023) published a report stating that the building sector is responsible for about 35% of energy-related emissions in the European Union for the year 2021.These emissions are primarily connected to activities like the combustion of fossil fuels within buildings, such as oil and gas boilers for heating, alongside electricity consumption for lighting, water heating, and cooling systems. In 2002, the EU introduced the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) with the main objective of promoting energy efficiency (EC 2002). The European Union acknowledged the importance of a new policy instrument to tackle the emissions from the building\nEPBD introduced the energy performance certificates (EPC) to tackle both the information failures, i.e. the information gap on the energy efficiency of properties that exists between property owners and prospective buyers, as well as the behavioral failure, such as decision-making heuristics and biases. This initiative aims to provide property buyers with accurate, direct, and cost-free information to ensure they can make well-informed decisions that would otherwise be contained by lack of transparency. Additionally, the information that the EPC reports provide can serve as a motivator for both owners and builders to invest in energy-efficient measures since it can be hypothesized that higher property prices and rents can result from a building’s improved energy performance. The Directive did not, however, compel property owners to publicly reveal the energy label, i.e., their property’s energy performance, in an advert. However, a recast of the EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings was set in place in 2010. This recast imposed on Member States to make it a requirement that property owners include the energy performance indicator, i.e. the energy performance rating ranging from A to G, in any commercial media real estate advertisement (EU 2010). Interestingly, between 2005 and 2021, total carbon dioxide emissions from the EU building sector dropped by 31% (European Enviroment Agency 2023)\nSince 1997, it has been mandatory in Denmark to have an energy certification. This makes Denmark one of the first countries in the EU to implement an EPC scheme, which includes benchmarking, an energy label, and an energy performance rating in the building sector. Interestingly, even though Denmark became one of the first to implement the system, they did not observe an impact on the real estate market until 2011, i.e., one year after the recast of the EPBD (Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016). The 2010 recast sparked many research studies to investigate the relationship between the energy performance of properties and property prices. The majority of the studies that investigate the EU housing market focus on the energy label. Other studies focus either on estimated or measured energy consumption. The results of these studies, however, have been mixed. Some studies identify significant price premiums associated with high energy performance labels or low energy consumption, whereas others observe no premium at all. Overall, the majority of studies identify significant price premiums, indicating a general trend toward the valuation of energy-efficient properties (Cespedes-Lopez et al. 2019). Concerning the Danish housing market, there is only a small amount of existing literature on the subject where the latest research that was found was conducted in the year 2016 (see Christensen et al. 2014; Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016; and Næss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund 2015). Furthermore, only a limited number of studies have taken into account additional information stated in the EPC reports, such as the renovation recommendations, renovations cost, and investment cost stated in the reports or the potential energy label a property can obtain from implementing recommended renovations.\nThis study investigates the relationship between energy performance and property prices by accounting for additional information taken from the reports. A hedonic model is applied to a unique data set of properties in Denmark from the years 2010 to 2023. Information is extracted using regular expressions, OCR, and NLP text classification techniques from over 776,106 EPC reports and then combined with scraped property characteristics and transaction data consisting of over 2.2 million observations, obtained from the website boliga.dk. Once all data is merged and cleaned, we obtain a final sample consisting of over 728,794 observations.\nWith this unique dataset, the contributions of this thesis are threefold. Firstly, it is the first paper to account for all residential property types in Denmark. To the best of our knowledge, all studies that investigate the Danish housing market have only focused on detached houses. Secondly, besides the energy label and energy consumption, we incorporate additional information from the EPC reports related to renovation potentials toward energy efficiency. The Idea here is that if consumers pay attention to the information in the EPC reports and are willing to pay a price premium for energy-efficient property, hence a discount for non-energy efficient property, then that premium/discount might vary depending on the renovation potential and the energy efficiency that the property can achieve from it. This might play a significant role in non-energy efficient properties. Finally, we measure the effect of tighter policy implementation for the Danish housing market on property renovations. The Danish authorities implemented tighter building regulations on January 1, 2018, which set minimum energy performance requirements for all new buildings and minimum energy efficiency requirements for renovations of existing buildings.\nThe thesis is structured as follows: Chapter 2: EPBD and the Danish EPC scheme introduces the implementation of the Energy Performance Certificates in Denmark and the structure of the reports. Subsequently, Chapter 3: Literature Review looks into the literature related to this paper. Chapter 4: Data chapter gives a detailed description of the data and how it was obtained. Chapter 5: Empirical Strategy outlines the theory of the hedonic model and the empirical strategy utilized in this paper. Finally, in the Chapter 6: Results, we present the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlin, David. 2022. “40% Of Emissions Come From Real Estate; Here’s How The Sector Can Decarbonize.” Forbes, April. https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidcarlin/2022/04/05/40-of-emissions-come-from-real-estate-heres-how-the-sector-can-decarbonize/.\n\n\nCespedes-Lopez, Maria-Francisca, Raul-Tomas Mora-Garcia, V.

    "section": "",
    "text": "With the establishment of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in 2001, the EU constructed its main legislative tool to improve the energy performance of buildings. With this Directive, EU members were given a framework to develop regulations for the energy efficiency of buildings. The framework provided a rounded structure on matters such as defining energy performance and methodology to quantify and measure the energy efficiency of buildings (EC 2002). Thus, the EU Commission highlighted the importance of energy conservation in buildings and formulated the EPC system. From 2006 onwards, the EPC system was gradually implemented across member states, with all states mandated to have an operational system in place by the final deadline of 4 January 2009 (Arcipowska et al. 2014). Since 2002, the EU Commission has updated the Directive through the years. In 2010, the EU recast the EPBD (European Directive 2010/31/EU) by updating the previous Directive as well as improving the quality of the Energy Performance Certification scheme by implementing additional requirements regarding independent qualified and/or accredited experts authorised to perform assessments of a building’s energy performance (EU 2010). Moreover, The EU Commission later expanded the scope of the recast in January 2012 by introducing a comparative methodology framework to determine the most cost-effective levels of minimum energy performance standards for both buildings and building elements. The recast of the EPBD played a vital role in enhancing transparency in the methodology of the energy performance of buildings and minimising potential information asymmetries between the property buyer and seller. Before the recast, sellers were not obligated to publicly display the energy performance of the property. Sellers could simply showcase the certificate at the time of signing the purchase agreement or rental contract. However, this changed with the recast, which required that when buildings\n\n“are offered for sale or for rent, the energy performance indicator of the energy performance certificate of the building or the building unit, as applicable, is stated in the advertisements in commercial media” (EU 2010, 24)\n\nThe fundamental motivations of the recast was to push for more sustainable development and make critical information more accessible to potential buyers and renters such that it fosters greater demand for energy-efficient buildings. By doing so, the goal is to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the housing sector. As a result, EPCs simplify the procedure of comparing similar buildings and can help boost awareness in the market towards energy efficiency, which intends to assist the EU in achieving its sustainability goals. (Arcipowska et al. 2014)\nMembers of the European Union have a degree of freedom to develop their measurement systems, accreditation requirements, and EPC layouts under the subsidiarity principle. Nevertheless, they are required to be in line with the EU framework policy given in the EPBD and meet the minimum methodology requirement specified in Annex 1 in the Directive. Certain key information must be displayed in the EPCs to fulfil EPBD requirements. This includes the energy performance index, which reflects the energy efficiency rating of the building, as well as reference values, such as minimum energy performance requirements, enabling comparison between different buildings. Expert recommendations are also required, where possible, and feasible home renovations that can improve the energy performance of the building are listed. Finally, the methodology estimate needs to be standardised at the national level. (EU 2010)\nA report made by Arcipowska et al. (2014) gives a clear overview of the implementation of EPC across the EU and the different countries that implement an EPC scheme. From the report, it can be seen that over the course of the implementation, the majority of countries have developed a letter-based rating scheme, for instance, on a scale from A to G, where A is most efficient and G is least efficient. These ratings are determined either based on specific energy consumption values or by comparing the building’s performance to reference buildings. Furthermore, the majority of countries have made it a requirement that qualified experts must make an on-site visit to the property to issue an energy performance certificate for existing buildings, that includes Denmark. The on-site requirement is one of the ways to ensure that the quality of the input data is upheld for the calculation process.\nSince the year 1997, it has been mandatory in Denmark to have an energy certification. Denmark was the first EU member to construct a complete building certification scheme, which consisted of an energy performance label system ranging from labels A to G. The Danish Energy Agency projected a positive impact on market activity by promoting the sale of highly energy-efficient buildings from an early implementation. Additionally, Danish policymakers argued that the implementation of the energy performance rating for buildings would not only raise the energy efficiency standards of the building stock, but would also serve as an important motivator in driving the society’s overall efforts towards reducing carbon emissions (Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016). As a result, starting from 1 January 1997, every building that was listed for sale was required to have a valid energy performance rating (Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016). Interestingly, Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh (2016) point out in their paper that even though Denmark became one of the first EU members to implement a scheme, there was no observable effect for 15 years. The Danish authorities implemented the 2010 EBPD recast almost two weeks after it got passed, i.e. on 1 July 2010. One year later, an effect was observed on the market. Danish real estate agents claimed that the easiest properties to sell were properties with higher energy performance. (Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016)\nThe Danish EPC scheme is maintained by the Danish Energy Agency (DEA). They are responsible for monitoring, maintaining quality assurance, and conducting further developments on the program. In order to receive an EPC report for a given building, a property must be inspected by a licensed energy consultant, which then will determine the building’s energy performance (Concerted Action EPBD 2020). The licensed energy consultant calculates the building’s energy consumption and signs a label on a scale from A to G, where A indicates the highest energy standard and G the lowest. He inspects the building’s quality concerning insulation, windows and doors, heating installation system, heating sources, etc. On this basis, the building’s energy consumption is calculated under certain assumptions such as weather, family size, operating hours, consumption habits, etc (“Energimærkning” n.d.). In other words, the energy consumption is theoretical. However, it is set up to reflect normal household consumption, given the building’s attributes. With that being said, it may not necessarily reflect the actual energy consumption, which is, of course, highly dependent on both the weather and the habits of the residence. Moreover, the EPC reports give an overview of the energy improvements that the energy consultants deem cost-effective to implement at the time of reporting.\nOver the years, the energy labels in Denmark have changed multiple times. Table Table 1.1 depicts the conversion from all the different energy labels that the Danish EPC scheme has had to the current labelling system, as well as the current official energy thresholds for each label. To this day, the A label in Denmark is split into three subcategories: A2020, A2015 and A2010. Where A2020 represents the most energy-efficient category, and G is labelled the least efficient. The 2013 scale is the official EPC labels in Denmark today. To this day, newly constructed buildings must have an energy label A2015 or A2020 (“Hvornår Skal Bygninger Energimærkes?” 2016). As Table Table 1.1 shows, a house of the size 100 square meters labelled D has an energy consumption between 167 (135+3200/100) and 217 (175+4200/100) kWh per square meter per year, i.e. between 16.700 to 21.700 kWh per year. On the other hand, a property of the same size with the label A2020 has an energy consumption equal to or less than 25 kWh per square meter per year i.e., 2,500 kWh per year or less.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Conversion table - EPC classification for residential buildings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\nscale\n2008V1\nscale\n2008V2\nscale\n2011\nscale\n2013\nscale\n(Current scale)\nThreshold limit\n2013-\n\\((kWh/m^2/year)\\)\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\nA2020\n\\[\\le 25\\]\n\n\nA1\n-\n-\nA1\nA2015\n\\[\\le 41.0 + 1000/A\\]\n\n\nA2\nA\nA1,A2\nA2\nA2010\n\\[\\le 71.3 + 1650/A\\]\n\n\nB1\nB\nB\nB\nB\n\\[\\le 95.0 + 2200/A\\]\n\n\nB2,C1\nC\nC\nC\nC\n\\[\\le 135+ 3200/A\\]\n\n\nC2,D1\nD\nD\nD\nD\n\\[\\le 175 + 4200/A\\]\n\n\nD2,E1\nE\nE\nE\nE\n\\[\\le 215 + 5200/A\\]\n\n\nE2,F1\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\\[\\le 265 + 6500/A\\]\n\n\nF2,G1,G2\nG\nG\nG\nG\n\\[&gt; 265 + 6500/A\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: the letter A in column “Threshold limit 2013 \\(kWh/m^2/year\\)” represents that heated living area. Data taken from Klima-, Energi- og Forsyningsministeriet (2015).\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this thesis will analyse the period 1. July 2010 to 2023. To quantify the label effects across the whole sampling period, all labels from older labeling systems are converted into the newest system based on the conversion table. Furthermore, within the period of this study, the layout and design of the Danish EPC reports have had three major changes. This is important because not all designs convey the exact same information. For clarity, the designs of the certificates will be referred to as Design 1, Design 2, and Design 3, where Design 1 is the oldest and Design 3 is the newest. The biggest difference is between the first design and the other designs. Essentially the renovation recommendation includes the following information: the type of renovation, estimated investment cost, and energy cost saved. In all designs, the renovations are categorised into two groups: profitable renovations and other renovations. The first group represents so-called “profitable renovations,” i.e., renovations that the licensed energy expert deems profitable based on estimated costs and savings. A renovation is deemed profitable if the energy savings can pay back the investment before the proposed renovation needs to be replaced again. As an example, if the proposal is to replace a circulation pump for hot water, the pump is expected to last for 15 years, and the savings proposal is considered profitable if the estimated energy savings can pay back the investment over 15 years. The second group will be referred to as the “non-profitable renovations”, which represent renovation proposals that cannot repay the investment before the proposed renovation needs to be replaced again. However, these renovations are often beneficial to consider if the building is being renovated or if there are building components that need to be replaced anyway. The profitable renovations include both investment cost, energy savings in Danish krone (DKK), and energy consumption saved. For non-profitable renovations, only the energy savings in DKK and the energy consumption saved are included. In addition to this, both EPC designs 2 and 3 include the energy label that a building would get from implementing profitable renovations and the energy label it would get from implementing all renovations, i.e. both profitable and non-profitable renovations. However, design one only includes the potential energy label the property would get from all renovations.

    "text": "A rising body of research has emerged over the past decades investigating the effects of energy efficiency on the housing market. This section will contain a review of related studies that focus on the residential property markets. With that being said, It can be very challenging to compare these types of studies. Buildings come in a wide range of forms and a variety of factors determine their market value at any particular point in time, including size, age, design, location, and quality condition. Moreover, there are many factors in which the studies differ such as methodologies used to derive robust results, the data, and the energy efficiency scheme system used in the country of interest and the functional form of variables. The majority of studies that will be reviewed in this chapter are studies that investigate the residential housing markets in countries that follow the EPC scheme. The reason for this is to mitigate to some degree the major differences between the studies. Given the impracticality of an entire list of research, a simple overview of all studies taken into consideration in this chapter are provided in Appendix A: Literature Review.\nFigure 2.1 displays the measured price premium and price discount for energy labels from selected papers that find significant price premiums. Note that the letter “X” on the plots represents insignificant results for a given energy label, while the triangle represents categories not considered by the paper. The circle represents the reference label, also referred to as the hold-out category. As illustrated in Figure 2.1, there exists a notable disparity in price premiums among countries, spanning from 1.3% in Finland to as high as 55% in Italy.\n\n\n\nCode\nsuppressWarnings({\n  \n  library(ggplot2)\n  library(gridExtra)\n  library(grid)\n  \n  legend_size &lt;- 1.1\n  plot_title_setSize &lt;- 20\n  set_axisTitle_size &lt;- 16\n  theX_size &lt;- 15\n    \n  ###############################################################\n  # ------------------ DENMARK \n  ###############################################################\n  \n  # Define the data\n  reference &lt;- \"D\"\n  values1 &lt;- c(6.20, 0, 0, 5.10, 0, -5.40, -12.90, -24.30) # from : https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.02.029\n  values2 &lt;- c(0, 1.02, 6.60, 3.5, 0, -3.60, -7.60, -12.10) # from : https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Energibesparelser/bilag_-_do_homes_with_better_energy_efficiency_ratings_have_higher_house_prices_oekonometrisk_tilgang.pdf\n  \n  \n  labels &lt;- c(\"A or B\",\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\")\n  country &lt;- \"Denmark\"\n  \n  # Reorder labels factor levels to ensure \"A/B\" appears first\n  labels &lt;- factor(labels, levels = c(\"A or B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"))\n  \n  # Create a data frame for values1\n  df1 &lt;- data.frame(labels = labels, values = values1, group = \"(Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016)\")\n  # Create a data frame for values2\n  df2 &lt;- data.frame(labels = labels, values = values2, group = \"(Næss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund 2015)\")\n  # Combine the data frames\n  df &lt;- rbind(df1, df2)\n  \n  # Define colors based on numeric values\n  reference_value1 &lt;- \"(Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016)\"\n  reference_value2 &lt;- \"(Næss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund 2015)\"\n  \n  # Define colors based on group\n  group_colors &lt;- c(\"(Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh 2016)\" = \"#B22222\",  # Light blue for Values1\n                    \"(Næss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund 2015)\" = \"#666666\")  # Dark blue for Values2\n  \n  \n  \n  ###### key var size\n  legend_key_size &lt;-0.85\n  legend_text_size &lt;- 15\n  triangle_size &lt;- 10\n  reference_circle_size &lt;- 13\n  x_label_size &lt;- 16\n  y_label_size &lt;- 18\n  \n  # Plot using ggplot2\n  plot_denmark &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = labels, y = values, fill = group)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"darkgrey\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"darkgrey\", size = 1) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = -Inf, color = \"darkgrey\", size = 1.5) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = seq(0.5, length(labels) -

Fuerst, Oikarinen, and Harjunen (2016) ; Norway - Khazal and Sønstebø (2023), Olaussen, Oust, and Solstad (2017); Padua, Italy - Copiello and Coletto (2023); Ireland - Hyland, Lyons, and Lyons (2013); Spain -

(2016); Netherlands - Brounen and Kok (2011)\n\n\nThe first study to investigate the connection between property prices and EPC labels was conducted by Brounen and Kok (2011). They found that energy-efficient labels have a significant positive effect on property prices, and low-energy-efficient labels are sold at a discount. The authors used a wide range of control variables, such as insulation quality, central heating, and level of maintenance. They managed to gather 177.000 housing transactions in the Netherlands for the period January 2008 to August 2009, of which 31.993 residential dwellings had energy performance certificates. At the time of the study, energy performance certificates were not fully mandatory in the Netherlands, i.e., the buyer of a home could sign a waiver, releasing the seller from the obligation to certify the home. Consequently, the implementation rate was low (Brounen and Kok 2011). For example, during the sample period, the implementation rate, i.e. the fraction of sold homes that had energy labels, was at 25% in January 2008 but dropped down to 10% in the summer of 2009, mainly due to negative media coverage (Brounen and Kok 2011). To account for sample selection bias, the authors applied a two-step Heckman model to examine the factors that impact whether or not a home has an energy rating and the effect the rating has on the pricing of rated homes. The authors find that adopting an energy label tends to coincide with challenging selling conditions and that larger homes are less likely to have an energy rating. Moreover, their findings reveal price premiums of 10%, 5%, and 2% for homes rated A, B, and C, respectively, as well as price discounts of 0.5%, 2.5%, and 5% for homes rated E, F, and G, respectively, when compared to homes labelled as D with similar characteristics. This link between house price and EPC rating served as an early indicator that energy efficiency was being valued in housing transactions where EPC labels were utilised.\n\n\nSimilar to Brounen and Kok (2011) paper, Hyland, Lyons, and Lyons (2013) find that homes in Ireland with the label A are sold with a 9.3% price premium compared to D labels, and B label homes are sold at a 5.2% premium compared to D. The time frame of their analysis is between years 2008 and 2012. During that time, it was not mandatory to display the energy efficiency of the Irish EPC scheme. The authors note that not all homes have a certificate. To counter the potential selection bias in their analysis, they employ a two-step Heckman model. In addition to the findings stated earlier, they also found that energy efficiency has a positive effect on renting prices, but significantly less than sales prices.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, Fuerst et al. (2015) employ a hedonic model to investigate the relationship between transaction prices on a variety of property types and energy performance ratings for the period 1995 to 2012. Their sample consisted of approximately 333.095 transaction prices. They utilised both the transaction price and dwellings price appreciation between two sales. For the transaction price, their result show that, on average, people are willing to pay 5% more for properties with energy labels A or B and 1.8% for properties with label C, compared to label D. In relation to that, Fuerst et al. (2016) investigated the Wales market with a sample size of 192.000 observations consisting mainly of detached, semi-detached and terraced homes. In comparison to D-labelled properties, their findings suggest that people are willing to pay 12.8% higher for properties with either A or B labels and 3.5% for C-labelled properties.\n\nFor Finland, Fuerst, Oikarinen, and Harjunen (2016) analysed Finland’s housing market from 2009-2012, focusing solely on apartments. With a sample size of only 6.203 but with a large number of neighbourhood and property characteristics, they find statistically significant price premiums for high-rated labelled apartments. Using the label D as the reference label, from their standard model and by combining the labels A, B, and C into a single dummy their estimated price premium is 18.23% compared. In addition, they find that the label E is sold at a discount of -8.16% compared. However, with the introduction of additional controls such as postal code, property characteristics, geographical characteristics, and neighbourhood attributes, the effect diminishes substantially. It leads to an estimate of a 1.3% price premium for labels A, B, and C, and the label E becomes insignificant. This result emphasises the importance of accounting for geographical, neighbourhood, and property characteristics. In addition to measuring the effect of the labels on apartment prices, Fuerst, Oikarinen, and Harjunen (2016) also measure the effect of energy-efficient labels on liquidity on the market. Their result indicates that highly energy-efficient properties do not appear to influence the liquidity of properties.\n\nSo far, all the studies mentioned agree on the positive relationship between energy efficiency and residential property prices.  A broader analysis conducted by the European Commission (2013) examined the impact of EPC labels on property value and rental rates in various cities in Europe. The study investigated the property markets in France, Belgium, Ireland, Austria, and the UK. In this report, the model specification, control variables, sample size, and the results vary significantly across countries. For each country, they treat the energy efficiency label as a continuous variable, thereby assuming a constant effect across all levels. They find statistically significant price premiums for energy-efficient properties in Austria, France, Belgium, and Ireland. However, in the UK no clear effect is found from energy efficiency on prices. It is stated in the report that this is potentially due to omitted variable bias, but one might also add that the sample size for the UK is remarkably small, consisting of only 236 observations. With that being said, the European Commission (2013) argues that the\n\n“Implementation and effectiveness vary from country to country and region to region depending on a range of factors, including the local political and legal context and the characteristics of the local property market. The existence of related incentives and subsidies at the national or regional level needs to be taken into account as well. In general, it can be said that low ambition in implementation leads to certification schemes of poor quality, i.e. not providing sufficient and accurate information or the necessary quality control.” (European Commission 2013, 17)\n\nIn contrast to regional segments, the European Commission (2013) finds that energy efficiency has a greater effect on prices in bigger cities than in rural areas in Austria. In France, they find that the effect is stronger in Marseille than in Lille, and in Marseille, the effect from energy efficiency is mainly driven by apartments rather than houses, whereas in Lille, it’s the opposite.\n\nIn Sweden, the study results have also been mixed. Högberg (2013), Cerin, Hassel, and Semenova (2014), Wahlström (2016), Stenvall et al. (2022) and Wilhelmsson (2023) all investigate energy efficiency on property prices in Sweden. These papers also share a common approach by quantifying energy efficiency by utilising energy consumption, with the exception of Wilhelmsson (2023) paper, which used both energy efficiency labels and energy consumption. Cerin, Hassel, and Semenova (2014) performs a hedonic model on a sample of 67.559 observations over the period 2009-2010. They Utilise standardised energy consumption as a proxy for energy efficiency and find that energy performance is associated with a price premium. The findings of Cerin, Hassel, and Semenova (2014) complement those of Högberg (2013).\nHögberg (2013) study specifically examines property prices in Stockholm. Using a hedonic model, their findings support the conclusion that energy performance level is associated with a price premium. Wilhelmsson (2023) also studies the housing market in Stockholm, however, in his analysis, he does things a bit differently. In contrast to Cerin, Hassel, and Semenova (2014), Wilhelmsson (2023) investigates the Stockholm housing market using both energy labels and energy consumption. He employs the traditional hedonic model as well as propensity score matching and spatial hedonic model. His findings confirm the price premium for energy-efficient properties, and his results also indicate that property buyers pay more attention to the expected energy consumption of a property than simply the energy label.\nStenvall et al. (2022) focus on the relationship between energy consumption and tenant-owned apartment prices. They find a positive price premium, however, it is not consistent across different market segments or model specifications. Finally, unlike the majority of the Swedish studies, Wahlström (2016) finds that there is no price premium associated with energy consumption. Wahlström (2016) studied single-family houses in Sweden during the period 2009-2010. He ran several hedonic regressions on a sample of 77.000 observations. Although he finds no price premium for energy consumption, his findings do suggest that buyers prioritise property components that improve energy efficiency. For instance, Wahlström (2016) finds that properties that use district heating are sold at a premium between 8-9% compared to properties that only use electricity for heating and cooling. Moreover, its findings suggest that properties with oil-fired boilers are sold at a discount of 10-11%, and having a ground-sourced heat pump leads to a price premium of 18%.\n\nBoth Olaussen, Oust, and Solstad (2017) and Olaussen et al. (2019) investigate the effect of energy efficiency on transaction prices in Oslo and find little to no effect. Olaussen, Oust, and Solstad (2017) argue that the differing results found in various studies regarding the price effect from energy efficiency in the real estate market may stem from differences in the methodological designs. They further argue that the positive effect found by many studies is due to the misspecification of the regression models and that these studies suffer from omitted variable bias. Therefore, the price premium found is capturing something else than the energy efficiency effects themselves. Olaussen, Oust, and Solstad (2017) used a unique dataset with observations of properties sold before and after energy labels were introduced in Norway. They begin by reproducing the positive price premium effect from energy labels using a traditional hedonic model, and then they run a fixed effects model, leading to insignificant results. Olaussen et al. (2019) extend Olaussen, Oust, and Solstad (2017) research by investigating the effects of both energy labels and energy consumption on transaction prices. Unlike the majority of papers, Olaussen, Oust, and Solstad (2017) quantify the energy performance by calculating the present value, using Gordon and Shapiro’s growth model, of the maximum energy consumption per square meter across all energy labels. Their findings suggest that the energy performance of dwellings, in general, is of little importance to buyers.\nWith all this being said, a newer study made by Khazal and Sønstebø (2023) contradicts these findings for the Norwegian housing market. Khazal and Sønstebø (2023) analysed a sample of 750.000 transaction prices and 670.000 rental prices across the whole country. They find positive effects from energy efficiency for both rental and sales markets. Their estimated price effect is between 0.8-1% for a one-letter improvement on the EPC rating scale. Additionally, they supply evidence indicating that the assessment of energy efficiency value is affected by endogeneity arising from unobserved geographical factors. Moreover, their findings indicate that properties with lower energy efficiency are subject to greater geographical bias in the rental market, whereas this bias is amplified for energy-efficient properties in the sales market. Finally, they show that lower energy-efficient properties correlate with reduced bias originating from unobserved quality in the sales market.\n\n% (Fregonara et al., 2017) = Energy performance certificates in the Turin real estate market % Barreca et al. (2021) EPC Labels and Building Features: Spatial Implications over Housing Prices % (Copiello \\& Coletto, 2023) The Price Premium in Green Buildings: A Spatial Autoregressive Model and a Multi-Criteria Optimization Approach\nFregonara, Rolando, and Semeraro (2017), Barreca, Fregonara, and Rolando (2021) and Copiello and Coletto (2023) investigated the effect of energy efficiency labels on property prices in Italy, where both Fregonara, Rolando, and Semeraro (2017) and Barreca, Fregonara, and Rolando (2021) focus on the city of Turin, but Copiello and Coletto (2023) on the city Padua. Interestingly, their results do not reflect the same conclusion. Fregonara, Rolando, and Semeraro (2017) focused on old properties in Turin and gathered a sample of only 879 observations for the period 2011-2014. He begins by running a traditional hedonic model, where the result does not support a price premium, yet it does support a price discount for labels E, F, and G. However, when more control variables and property characteristic variables are added, the effect vanishes, indicating that energy-efficient labels do not affect the price. Unlike the research by Fregonara, Rolando, and Semeraro (2017), Barreca, Fregonara, and Rolando (2021) put more emphasis on spatial analysis by employing both traditional hedonic price models but also spatial error models using listing price. Barreca, Fregonara, and Rolando (2021) point out that the presence of spatial autocorrelation usually affects the real estate markets, and it is important to acknowledge it. Using a spatial error model and listing price on a sample size of 2,092 observations, they find that energy efficiency labels have an effect. According to their result from the spatial error model, property buyers are willing to pay a 6.2% higher price for energy labels A, B, and C compared to label D. Additionally, properties in labels E, F, and G are sold at a discount of 2.7% compared to D label. However, the impact varies in different sub-markets. Unlike these two papers, Copiello and Coletto (2023) identify substantially larger price premiums and discounts for energy efficiency and inefficient labels. They employ a spatial autoregressive model on a sample size of only 321 observations, using listing price as the dependent variable. Based on their result, with D-labeled properties as the reference group, property buyers in Padua are willing to pay a 55% higher price for properties labelled A4, 42% for those labelled A3, A2, or A and 20% for those labelled B or C. In contrast, non-energy efficient properties labelled F are sold at a discount of 17%, while those labelled G are sold at a discount of 29%.\nUnlike the results from Brounen and Kok (2011), which found significant price premiums for energy-efficient properties in the Netherlands, Murphy (2014) found that EPC is a weak influence both pre and post-purchase of properties. Using an online questionnaire, Murphy (2014) investigated the role of the EPC during the transaction process of buildings in the Netherlands. Only 10% of her observations stated that EPC influenced their decision-making when it came to buying their dwelling. Due to the weak influence, Murphy (2014) argues that if consumers continue to evaluate the energy-saving potential of buildings subjectively rather than using more objective measures, like the EPC reports, then the opportunity to realise significant energy savings in existing buildings will be neglected.\n\nThus far, we have primarily discussed findings on the direct relationship between energy efficiency labels and property prices across a somewhat aggregated setting. Other studies have delved deeper into the assessment of the effect in terms of different segments, e.g., market and social-economic segments, as these factors play an important role. For instance, in terms of income level, if we were to assume that the true effect of energy efficiency on property prices reflects a price premium, regardless of whether it is based on the label or the energy consumption, then one might wonder if the premium is, in fact, that similar across all income levels. For instance, a consumer with significant financial constraints might value energy-efficient attributes higher than those with little to no financial contains. With that being said, Cerin, Hassel, and Semenova (2014) argue that consumers who purchase lower-priced properties tend to place a higher value on factors related to energy efficiency, such as potential energy savings or lower energy bills. They find that 25% of their lowest transaction prices per square meter are significantly and negatively related to energy consumption. However, one might argue that if the market value of these attributes is high enough, then prices of energy-efficient properties might start to surpass the budget of consumers who have significant financial constraints. Therefore, energy-efficient properties might not be as highly valued by financially constrained consumers compared to less financially constrained consumers. Næss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund (2015) investigated the effect energy efficiency has on transaction prices in Denmark. Part of their analysis was to investigate if the price premium they found for energy-efficient properties varied across different disposable income segments. Using a random effect regression, they find that energy standards have the highest price premium for high-income buyers.\n\nThe importance of distinguishing between urban and rural areas becomes clear based on results from Taruttis and Weber (2022) and Hyland, Lyons, and Lyons (2013). Hyland, Lyons, and Lyons (2013) find that in urban areas, for each decline in the energy efficiency scale, there is a price discount of 1.2%. However, in rural areas, this discount is nearly twice as much, at 2.3%. This supports their hypothesis that energy efficiency has a greater impact on property prices in rural areas compared to urban areas, especially when selling conditions are challenging. This result is in line with Taruttis and Weber (2022) findings. Taruttis and Weber (2022) investigated the impact of energy efficiency on the German housing market, using listing prices of 422.242 observations for the period 2014-2018. They find that the impact of energy efficiency on property prices varies between urban and rural areas. With a reduction in energy consumption of 100 kWh/m2/year, the listed price of properties in big independent cities increases by 1.3%. However, in properties in sparsely populated areas, the energy efficiency is valued much higher, reaching 11.4% for a 100 kWh/m2/year reduction in energy consumption.\n\nIt is evident that energy consumption and temperature are closely related. Wilhelmsson (2019) takes that into consideration when estimating the impact of energy-efficient labels on transaction prices in Sweden. Sweden spans two distinct climatic zones: the subarctic climate zone, where the average yearly temperature ranges from 7-10 degrees, and the hemiboreal climate zone, where temperatures hover around 0 degrees. His findings show that energy efficiency is valued higher for properties in areas with colder climates than for properties in warmer climates.\n\nTo finalise this chapter, we move on to studies investigating the Danish housing market, i.e. the market of interest in this thesis. As stated earlier, Murphy (2014) argues that if consumers do not value the objective measures given in the EPC reports, then there is a risk that energy savings or energy saving potential will be overlooked. In connection with this, Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh (2016) argue that if the energy performance of buildings is not promoted in any way, then there will be limited acceptance or adoption on the market. They further point out that effective branding relies on two key elements. Firstly, the reports must maintain reliability and a trustworthy scheme, and secondly, ensure widespread awareness and understanding of energy performance ratings among both buyers and sellers of properties.\nThe study conducted by Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh (2016) focuses on the impact before and after the display of energy-efficient ratings became mandatory. The study contains 117.483 transaction prices on detached single-family houses in Denmark, spanning the period 2007 to 2012. Their study is unique because EPC reports in Denmark have been mandatory since 1997. Jensen, Hansen, and Kragh (2016) employ two hedonic regressions with time and place-fixed effects: one for the period before the mandatory display of EPC labels in advertisements and another after its implementation. They find that before the policy was implemented, there was a price premium for energy-efficient properties. However, with the implementation of the policy, the premium increased significantly, thus validating the importance of promoting energy efficiency.\nNæss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund (2015) take a deeper look into the Danish housing market and its relations with energy efficiency, making it particularly relevant to this study. By employing various modelling techniques, they examine both national trends and specific market segments. They utilise a sample of 354.780 observations, of which 136.386 observations are associated with an EPC report and 218.394 do not. Based on their final result, they find that properties with label A are sold at a price premium of 10.2%, B at 6.6%, and C at 3.5% compared to label D. For the non-energy efficient labels, they measure discounts of 3.6%, 7.6% and 12.1% for labels E, F and G respectfully. One of the reasons for this thesis is that only a handful of studies have examined the impact of energy-efficient renovations on property prices, as indicated in the EPC reports. Næss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund (2015) explored this using a random effects model and concluded that the options for renovation do not significantly impact the sales price. They highlight two potential explanations for this result: firstly, poor conditions may be more likely to undergo renovations. However, although renovation options may have a positive impact, this effect could be diminished by the lower initial value of such properties. Secondly, they point out that this might be due to a lack of quality data concerning energy renovation recommendations. With that being said, they did find that properties built between 1930 and 1960 are sold at a significantly higher price premium compared to houses built before 1930, potentially explaining the insignificance resulting from renovation options.\nNæss-Schmidt, Heebøll, and Fredslund (2015) findings correspond with the results obtained in Christensen et al. (2014) research. Christensen et al. (2014) conducted a survey study, gathering 743 observations to examine the impact of EPC reports on energy retrofitting practices among Danish homeowners. Based on their results, homeowners regard the EPC reports as trustworthy and straightforward. They have limited impact when it comes to energy-efficient renovations. Their findings challenge the assumption that homeowners act as “economically rational” actors who consider payback time as the most important factor in relation to energy-efficiency improvements. They find that homeowners focus more on other financial and practical aspects, such as the actual size of the investment and finding reliable trades-persons. The authors conclude that the reports fail to encourage homeowners to undertake energy-efficient renovations.\n\nFigure Figure 2.2 shows the dependent variable used, i.e., property prices, as well as variable of interest such as energy label or energy consumption, along with the types of control variables and property types utilised in the 25 research papers taken into consideration in this thesis. It is worth noting that some papers, such as the paper by the European Commission (2013) include multiple studies. Consequently, a single paper may sometimes contain more than one feature. From the figure, it is clear that each study differs significantly. Whether in terms of the specification of dependent variables or the variables accounted for, the diversity is high. This makes the papers not easily comparable to each other even though they all follow the same energy-efficient framework, which is also implemented differently across countries. Therefore, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. With all that being said, we can conclude that the majority of the literature finds that energy-efficient homes carry a price premium and non-energy-efficient homes carry price discounts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n# all data was collected from the papers referenced in this master thesis\n# and save in the excel file called:\n#---&gt;

    "title": "4.1 Housing data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ministry of Taxation of Denmark hosts the website “ois.dk” (https://www.ois.dk), which offers open access to the country’s property records . Users can obtain both dwelling characteristics and transaction prices for the dwelling. However, the only restriction is that to browse through the data, one must have an address or an identification code for the dwelling. In light of this, we instead collect our housing data by web scraping the website “boliga.dk” (https://www.boliga.dk) using Python programming language and various libraries . The site provides users with unrestricted access to extensive property descriptions, historical transaction prices, and, for certain dwellings, listing prices, as well as advertisement metrics like the number of advertisements and duration on the market. We web scrape the whole site under the condition that dwellings have been at least sold once during period 1. July 2010 to 2023. Moreover, we exclude vacation homes from our web scraping process. Once the data is collected, we obtain a sample of 2.295.344 transactions, which belong to 981.469 dwellings. However, once we merge the housing data with the EPC data, our sample goes down to 994.769 transactions, of which belong to 711.591 dwellings. We merge the two data sets using two property authentication codes. The next chapter explains in detail the merging process of two datasets.\nAfter merging the housing data with the EPC data, we remove observations that are likely to introduce potential bias. Initially, as this analysis is entirely focused on residential dwellings, we remove all dwellings that do not reflect a residential dwelling based on categories from the Building and Housing Register of Denmark or BBR (Bygnings- og Boligregistret) which we obtained from scraping . These categories include buildings used for movie theatres, swimming pools, kindergarten buildings, hospitals, holiday homes, etc. Moreover, we also exclude dwellings registered as farmhouses (in Danish: Landejendom or stuehus). This type of dwelling is excluded not only because they do not reflect a typical residential dwelling but also because they often include a significant portion of land and additional buildings. Incorporating these observations poses a problem due to the nature of the EPC reports, which only belong to a single building structure.\nFor instance, based on our data, we would perceive a farmhouse observation as a single farmhouse dwelling with a large plot of land and an EPC label of A, when in fact there could be multiple independent houses on the land, which we do not have the EPC reports of. Therefore, it can become relatively complex to quantify farmhouses, and if these factors are not accounted for, then our sample would not accurately represent the properties being evaluated and can lead to our estimates being biased. Hence, we remove observations representing farmhouses and non-residential dwellings based on BBR categories.\nNext, we remove transactions that occurred before 2010 and transactions that were made at an auction, between family members, or under circumstances not aligned with free-market terms. Moreover, to account for the likelihood of property flipping by buyers and to minimise potential data inaccuracies, we remove transactions from dwellings sold more than once within a year. Moreover, we drop properties that do not have toilet or kitchen facilities, buildings that are condemned by governmental authorities, and observations with transaction prices equal to zero.\nFinally, we identified observations with potential data errors, where the EPC variables were inconsistent, indicating possible extraction error or errors in the original PDF reports. To ensure integrity of our analysis, we excluded these observations. The final data sets contains 728,754 transactions for 574,157 unique dwelling units.\nFigure 3.1 shows the average property prices across municipalities in Denmark. There is a noticeable disparity in property prices between municipalities, particularly between densely populated areas and rural regions. Our data reveals that the municipality of Fredriksberg in the capital region records the highest property price per square meter, reaching an average of 48,998.6 DKK (or 6,369.8 euros) per square meter. Conversely, Lolland municipality has the lowest average price per square meter, amounting to 6,423 DKK (or 835 euros) per square meter, which is more than seven times less than in Fredriksberg.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1\n\n\n\n\nAverage price per square meter at municipality level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1 presents summary statistics of property transaction and main property characteristics variables included in the regression analysis. Our dataset reveals several noteworthy aspects. Close to 60% of the sample is made up of detached houses, with apartments accounting for close to 30%. 71% of the sample was built more than 50 years ago. Most properties in our sample have fiber-cement as roof material, which is in line with the population of buildings, according to . Surprisingly, approximately one-third of our sample features fibre-cement roofs containing asbestos. Moreover, according to Danish building regulations, significant renovations or extensions must be declared if they represent at least 15% of the building’s estimated pre-renovation value . That being said, close to 70% of the sample has not experienced significant renovations. Given that a large portion of our sample contains fairly old properties and that many of these properties have not been significantly renovated, this might explain why a large portion of our sample still has asbestos material on their roofs.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Housing data - summary statistics\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n      \n        Continuous Variables\n      \n  \n\n\n  \n    Variable\n    N\n    Mean\n    Std.
