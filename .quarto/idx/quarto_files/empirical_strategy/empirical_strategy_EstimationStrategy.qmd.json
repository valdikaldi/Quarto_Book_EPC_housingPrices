To do this, an OLS regression with fixed effects is estimated. This model will lay the foundation as our baseline model and resemble the majority of regressions from the literature, particularly studies by @naess-schmidt_homes_2015 and @wahlstrom_doing_2016. For the baseline model, we begin by estimating a parsimonious version of the baseline model, then gradually introduce various control variables, resulting in the final form of our baseline regression equation as follows:\n\n\n$$\nLn(P_{izt}) = \\beta EE_{i} + \\mathbf{\\gamma X_{i}} + \\mathbf{\\delta Q_{i}} + \\mathbf{\\eta G_{i}} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau_{t}} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu_{z}} + \\boldsymbol{\\upsilon_{zt}} + \\epsilon_{izt}\n$${#eq-main_1}\n\n\nThe dependent variable \\( Ln(P_{izt}) \\) denotes the natural logarithm of the transaction price of dwelling \\( i \\) at four-digit postal code \\( z \\) at month \\( t\\). The variable of interest is denoted as \\( EE_{i} \\) and represents the EPC label of dwelling \\( i \\). Vector \\( \\mathbf{X_{i}} \\) contains structural characteristics of property, such as living space, number of rooms and floors. The vector \\( \\mathbf{Q_{i}} \\) contains factors quantifying the general condition of the property, such as construction year and year of significant renovation. The structure of the variables from the \\( \\mathbf{X_{i}} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{G_{i}} \\) aligns with the majority of the literature. For example, as pointed out in [Chapter 4.1](../data/data_housing.qmd), we follow the approach of @jensen_market_2016 by structuring the year of construction for properties into periodic bins. @jensen_market_2016 grouped the years into periods reflecting both building tradition and energy performance. The only difference between our variable and theirs is an additional bin for the newer years, as our sample spans a longer period. By structuring the variable, as well as other continuous variables, in a categorical format, we are able to capture non-linear effects. Furthermore, \\( \\mathbf{G_{i}} \\) represents the neighbourhood structure of properties. The vector comprises several geographical characteristics, including population density at the 1 km grid level. All continuous control variables have been logarithmised. The previous chapter, [Chapter 4](../data/data_housing.qmd), presents details on all the variables used in our analysis, including their structural forms.\n\n% fixed effects :\nThe sample of this analysis spans a long period of time, raising concerns about temporal variation in property prices over the time period. Factors such as seasonality, economic conditions and policy changes all have the potential to impact property prices. To account for this, we include month and year-fixed effects, denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau_{t}}$. Moreover, as pointed out earlier in this paper, location plays a vital role as a determinant of property prices. Even though we account for some neighbourhood characteristics, there is still a great risk of unobserved heterogeneity in local market conditions such as school districts, demographic characteristics or other neighbourhood amenities that we do not account for. Therefore, we include 4-digit postal code fixed effects, denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\mu_{z}}$, to control for spatially correlated factors that can influence property prices. With it, we reduce omitted variable bias and improve the robustness of the estimated effects. Furthermore, the housing market can vary significantly, not just by area but also over time within the same area. For example, certain areas might experience seasonal demand fluctuations, infrastructure developments or local economic changes that impact housing prices differently over time. By interacting with the time and postal code fixed effects, we account for localised temporal trends in housing prices. This further mitigates omitted variable bias, which arises from factors that vary both by location and over time. The interaction is denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon_{zt}}$\n\nAs pointed out in the introduction, the majority of papers do not incorporate additional information in their analysis from the EPC reports related to the renovation potential. In order to deepen our understanding of the impact of energy efficiency on property prices, the baseline model is extended by incorporating additional information derived from the EPC reports, specifically related to energy-efficient renovation potential. Thus, we add the vector $\\mathbf{\\phi EER_{i}}$ to @eq-main_1 Equation \\ref{eq: baseline model}, resulting in the final regression equation taking the following form:  \n\n$$\nLn(P_{izt}) = \\beta EE_{i} + \\mathbf{\\phi EER_{i}} + \\mathbf{\\gamma X_{i}} + \\mathbf{\\delta Q_{i}} + \\mathbf{\\eta G_{i}} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau_{t}} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu_{z}} + \\boldsymbol{\\upsilon_{zt}} + \\epsilon_{izt}\n$${#eq-main_2}\n\nHere, the vector $\\mathbf{\\phi EER_{i}}$ (Energy efficient Renovations) denotes a set of property-specific control variables related to their renovation potential as specified by the following equation: \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\phi EER_{i}} = \\phi_{1} LabelJump_{i} + \\phi_{2} TECS{i} + \\phi_{3} TICP_{i} + \\mathbf{\\phi_{4} RS_{i}}\n$${#eq-main_2_part}\n\n\nwhere $LabelJump_{i}$ is a categorical variable representing the number of EPC labels a property would advance from its current label upon implementing all renovation suggestions made in the EPC report. $TECS_{i}$ represents the total energy cost saved for the property from implementing all renovation suggestions, while $TICP_{i}$ represents the total investment cost needed to implement the  profitable renovation suggestions. In order to interpret $TECS_{i}$ and $TICP_{i}$ as elasticity's we take the natural logarithm of both variables. However, this leads to a log-0 problem as many observations have zero in both variables. Therefore, we add the constant equal to one before taking the logarithm to overcome this issue. \n\nFinally, the vector $\\mathbf{RS_{i}}$ (Renovation suggestions) contains dummy variables indicating the types of renovations that are required, such as renovating the roof or attic renovation, renovating the building walls or conversion to district heating. $\\mathbf{\\phi EER_{i}}$ allows us to capture the static role of the EPC label while also considering the evolving potential for increased energy efficiency and further energy savings. This allows us to determine if home buyers are willing to pay a premium for homes that are already energy efficient as well as those that offer the potential for further enhancements in energy efficiency. As a result, we obtain a more thorough study of the economic gains associated with energy efficiency in the housing market. Additionally, these factors assist in accounting for potential endogeneity and omitted variable bias caused by unobserved renovation characteristics. \n\nFurthermore, As discussed in chapter \\ref{chap: literature Review}, all related empirical studies on the Danish housing market have focused exclusively on detached houses. On the other hand, as shown in \\ref{subchap:housing_data}, our unique dataset encompasses a diverse range of property types. These property types differ both in structural characteristics and market dynamics. As a result, it is critical to recognise that the impact might vary significantly between property types. The model specified in @eq-main_2 Equation \\ref{eq:finalRegression} was estimated across different property type segments to assess this hypothesis.\n\nFinally, we attempt to quantify the effect from a tighter building regulations that took place on 1. January 2018. The regulation increased the energy performance standards for new buildings and set stricter regulations for renovations on existing properties such that the renovations made meet a minimum energy efficiency standard. Thereby, enforcing that when renovations on existing buildings take place, they truly improve energy efficiency towards buildings. To quantify the policy effect, we split our sample by the date of the policy such that one sub-sample represents the market before the policy took place and the other after the policy took place. Then we run model equivalent to  Equation \\ref{eq:finalRegression} on both sub-samples.  \n\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n# 5.2 Estimation Strategy\n\n\n::: paratext\n\nWe will begin by estimating the impact of EPC labels on transaction prices to determine if consumers are willing to pay more for energy-efficient dwellings.
