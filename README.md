# Are home buyers inattentive towards energy efficiency?

An empirical project, conducted as part of my Master’s thesis in Applied Economics and Data Science. 
This project examines whether Danish private property buyers are price-sensitive to the energy class of the property and specific energy-related components.

For this purpose, a new dataset is created by web scraping 2,295,344 property transactions and characteristics of Danish properties, and extracting information from 776,108 PDF documents from Energy Performance Certificates (EPC), using binary text classification models, along with NLP and OCR techniques, to extract data on prices, energy efficiency, and other property characteristics.

The website was made using Quarto.
