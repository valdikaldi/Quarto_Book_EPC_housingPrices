	abstract = {The German government is aiming for a climate-neutral building stock before 2050 to meet the defined goals of the Climate Action Plan 2050. Increasing the building stock's energy efficiency is therefore a high priority, and investments by private homeowners will greatly influence this, as around 46.5\% of German homes are owner-occupied. To identify the possible monetary benefits of investments in energy retrofits, we investigate whether energy efficiency is reflected in the property values of German single-family homes. Therefore, we examine potential heterogeneous effects across regions. With 422,242 individual observations on a 1 km2-grid level from 2014 to 2018, this study adds to the extant literature by 1) examining the energy efficiency effect on housing values for the entire country and specifically investigating regional disparities in this context, and 2) estimating an energy efficiency value-to-cost ratio to compare housing values' increase with initial investment costs and future energy cost savings. Applying hedonic analysis, we find a positive relationship between energy efficiency and asking prices. If energy efficiency increases by 100 kWh/m2a, prices increase by 6.9\% on average. We also find evidence for regional disparities. The effects are significantly weaker in large cities than in other urban areas, whereas the impact in rural regions is much stronger. According to this, housing shortage and higher purchasing power per capita were identified as drivers for low energy efficiency premiums. Finally, there is evidence that about 98\% of future energy cost savings are already reflected in a higher housing value under myopic expectations regarding future energy prices.},

	abstract = {In this paper the issue of market capitalization of energy efficient buildings is addressed by considering single-family housing in Sweden and through analyzing as to what extent the market price for a house is influenced by its energy performance. Are Swedish homeowners doing well by doing good? We make use of information provided by the Swedish energy performance certificates for single-family homes matched with data on the corresponding transaction prices, household characteristics and attributes of the neighborhood. The resulting database, covering about 77,000 individual observations, is used to analyze the relationship between the price of a house and its energy performance by means of a hedonic model. Unlike most other studies the energy performance is decomposed into energy consumption and several other variables characterizing the energy system. The main question addressed is if there is a price premium for energy efficient housing in Sweden. Our results differ from earlier studies and indicate no price premium related to the energy consumption but substantial premiums for housing attributes that improve the energy efficiency. A likely explanation is that prospective buyers of new homes base their expectations about future energy consumption on those attributes rather than on the energy consumption of the previous owner.},

The contribution of EPC labels to house prices and to market liquidity was measured to analyze different aspects of the selling process. Design/methodology/approach A traditional hedonic model was used to explain the variables of listing price, transaction price, time on the market and bargaining outcome. In addition to EPC labels, the building construction period and the main features of apartments were included in the model. A sample of 879 transactions of old properties in Turin in 2011-2014 was considered. Findings A first hedonic model let us suppose that low EPC labels (E, F and G) were priced in the market although EPC labels explained only 6-8 per cent of price variation. A second full hedonic model, which included apartment characteristics, revealed that EPC labels had no impact on prices. Originality/value In Italy EPC has been mandatory for house transactions since 2009, so there are few studies on the effect of EPC on the Italian real estate market at least to our knowledge. Furthermore, unusually for the Italian context, in this paper also transaction prices were analyzed, in addition to the more frequently used listing prices.},

	abstract = {Energy performance certificates (EPCs) were introduced to give property buyers better information about the energy efficiency of dwellings and provide incentives to make energy-efficient investments. Previous studies on the effect of EPCs on property value have yielded divergent results, with some studies finding that energy labels affect property values, but others finding that energy labels have little or no effect. The present paper takes the analysis one step further. Using data on energy prices in combination with transaction data from Oslo, we conclude that not only the energy label, but also the energy performance of dwellings in general, has little to no effect on transaction prices. This result is in line with the inferences of several survey studies, which indicate that when people buy a dwelling, they pay considerably less attention to its energy performance compared with other factors, such as the location, neighborhood, size, garden, and the number of bedrooms.},

On the real estate market, it was expected that an energy label, rating the energy performance of a property based on a national energy performance certificate (EPC) might receive similar response. However, in Denmark no response to the energy performance rating was observed for 15 years. This was a surprise considering that Denmark was the first country to implement an A to G rating of the energy performance of buildings. A statistical examination of data on property sales prices and energy performance ratings was carried out. All relevant property transaction data from 2007 till 2012 were examined and they showed that energy performance ratings had an impact on property sales prices. However, before June 2010, the impact was modest, whereas after June 2010 the impact of energy performance ratings on property sales prices increased significantly as a result of an EU requirement to display the energy performance rating in connection with property sales. On this background, it was concluded that a public display of the energy performance rating is fundamental for market response.},

The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), introduced in 2002 and revised in 2010, is a key instrument to increase the energy performance of buildings across the European Union. Following the implementation of the EPBD into Spanish law, all properties offered for sale or rented out in Spain are required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). Given that the implementation of the EPC scheme for new, existing and advertised properties is still very low in Spain, unlike other European housing markets, the Spanish one lacks market data on energy efficiency (EE) labels and their impact on housing price. To overcome this gap, we determine the EE ratings of a sample of 1507 homes across Spain on the basis of information collected previously through household surveys. This allowed us to answer the question of whether or not, and to what extent, Spanish housing markets capitalise the value of EE. We apply the hedonic-price technique and observe that more energy efficient dwellings have a price-premium between 5.4\% and 9.8\% compared to those with the same characteristics but lower EE level.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings on residential prices in Wales. Drawing on a sample of approximately 192,000 transactions, the capitalisation of energy efficiency ratings into house prices is investigated using two approaches. The first adopts a cross-sectional framework to investigate the effect of EPC rating on price. The second approach applies a repeat-sales methodology to investigate the impact of EPC rating on house price appreciation. Statistically significant positive price premiums are estimated for dwellings in EPC bands A/B (12.8\%) and C (3.5\%) compared to houses in band D. For dwellings in band E (−3.6\%) and F (−6.5\%) there are statistically significant discounts. Such effects may not be the result of energy performance alone. In addition to energy cost differences, the price effect may be due to additional benefits of energy efficient features. An analysis of the private rental segment reveals that, in contrast to the general market, low-EPC rated dwellings were not traded at a significant discount. This suggests different implicit prices of potential energy savings for landlords and owner-occupiers.},

While there is a large body of literature on how energy efficiency affects the sales price of single-family houses, none has exclusively focused on tenant-owned apartments. For owners of tenant-owned apartments in Sweden, heating is for a large share included in the monthly fee paid to the tenant association, which usually does not change on a short-term basis. This raises the question whether homebuyers’ incentives for acquiring energy-efficient tenant-owned apartments are large enough to be capitalized into the prices. By hedonic models and matching methods, we found mixed results. In our most optimistic scenarios, tenant-owned apartments enclosed in energy-efficient buildings are sold with a premium of approximately 0.8 to 1.2\% compared to apartments in non-efficient buildings. The results in this study are not robust to all model specifications and vary across regions. In comparison with recent studies using data for single-family houses in Sweden, our detected capitalization is smaller. Our results highlight a need for targeted measures if EPCs are to be fully capitalized in prices for all dwelling types in which buyers have different economic incentives for reducing their energy consumption.},

Second, the sample is split on the basis of a multivariate segmentation. Finally, separated hedonic models are specified again. The results suggest that in general, there is a modest impact of EPC ratings on listing prices, nonetheless it is not homogeneous across housing segments: (1) for the most modern apartments, with state-of-the-art features and active environmental comfort, energy ratings seem to play a null role in the formation of prices; (2) conversely, for the cheapest apartments, apartments boasting the most basic features, and apartments located in low-income areas, the “brown discount” is enormously significant, potentially depreciating the equity of those who have the least resources to carry out an energy retrofit. These results have implications for the assessment of the EPBD and its Spanish transposition, since a very well-intentioned environmental policy could have potentially harmful social repercussions in the absence of corrective measures.},

We add to the literature by more specifically controlling for potential biases, by employing a combination of alternative approaches to estimate the causal relationship between house prices and energy performance certificates. We use a traditional hedonic modeling approach, but we additionally employ propensity score methods to be able to compare treated houses with a control group. We also investigate the impact of the outliers, spatial dependency, and parameter heterogeneity of our estimates. Moreover, we use the quantile regression technique to test the hypothesis that the capitalization effect varies across the price distribution. Our results, analyzing more than 100,000 observations, indicate there is an upward bias if one is not controlling for outlier and selection bias. Regardless of the propensity score method approach, the results are lower than a model (around 3 percent capitalization, compared to 6 percent). However, our results do not support that the impact of energy performance certificates varies in the price distribution. Consequently, the certificates are not differently capitalized in the high-end housing price segment. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that the energy performance certificate should be more capitalized into house prices in the northern and colder parts of Sweden than in the southern regions.},

We analyse how EPC capitalised on housing prices during 2012–2018 for detached houses in Stockholm. This was previously carried out, but our contribution is to analyse both the effect of energy rating or labelling (A–G) and energy consumption (kWh/m²). How energy performance is communicated or displayed to potential buyers conveys that the format, style, and content of energy performance information may influence how buyers perceive its value and impact on the property’s market price. We have information on energy rating, consumption, or both for selected properties. This allows us to test the hypothesis that how energy performance is presented affects pricing. We also tested whether information affects different age cohorts differently. The results indicate that how energy performance is presented and visualised is important and that information about rating and consumption might be considered as a substitute for each other. It is also clear that the capitalisation effect differs depending on the age of the building.},

This paper uses different identification strategies for the Norwegian residential sales (N = 750,000) and rental (N = 670,000) markets to highlight the endogeneity and methodological limitations associated with assessing the price effects of energy efficiency and the signaling effect of label adoption. We find that the valuation of energy efficiency is subject to unobserved location and quality bias, that labeling has immediate, short-run, and long-run price effects and that different effects are observed in different submarkets.

Findings Results indicate that better energy performance effects selling prices positively. Energy efficiency recommendations seem to have an impact on sale price; home buyers seem to require a larger “discount” for more complex types of measures. Research limitations/implications The sample only includes houses in the Stockholm; so-called sustainable buildings have not been specifically studied; and the heating source has not been accounted for. Originality/value The EU energy performance certificates provide new information and measure energy performance more exactly than many earlier (proxy) variables.

Danish homeowners’ experiences with the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) are examined, as it was introduced in 1997 (prior to a similar scheme introduced later in the European Union). The main research question is whether the EPC has an influence on Danish homeowners’ energy retrofit practices. Homeowners’ understanding of and trust in the EPC are analyzed, based on an online survey of homeowners (N = 743) living in a home with a recently issued EPC. Results indicate that the EPC has a limited influence on homeowners’ energy retrofit practices. Despite most homeowners finding the EPC reliable and easy to understand, relatively few find it useful as a source of information for home retrofits. In its current form, the EPC is insufficient to encourage homeowners to undertake energy retrofits of their home. Improvements to address this problem in the administration, scope and layout of the EPC are suggested.},

Many energy efficiency technologies have failed to deliver on the promised savings. This paper measures the extent to which residential dwelling retrofit delivers real energy savings in Ireland using a unique dataset of whole-home energy use (n = 8,572 households) over a two-year period. It is one of the largest studies of retrofit using whole-home energy data for a general housing sample, who do not disproportionately experience fuel poverty. It uses whole-home energy data to capture potential fuel switching induced by retrofit. Finally, this study addresses concerns regarding self-selection issues associated with the decision to undergo a retrofit by comparing with a second control group of homes that received a retrofit prior to the observation period. Results following a generalised difference-in-difference methodology indicate that retrofits reduce energy use by 1,091 kWh/year, on average. However, the magnitude of savings depends on the measures installed. Further analysis suggests that retrofits represent better value for money when factoring in actual changes in energy use. This study highlights possible unintended consequences of retrofit policies that may hinder progress towards national energy efficiency targets.},

	abstract = {Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) aim to inform owners, occupiers, tenants, real estate agents and other relevant groups about the energy efficiency of buildings. Although house buyers and renters often recognize these certificates, they often do not use them. One explanation for this is lack of trust in these certificates. This paper presents the results of an online survey (n = 354), in which the role of perceived source credibility, trust in the certificate and people’s involvement in energy efficiency was studied on renters’ attitudes towards EPCs in Ireland, so-called BER labels. The results showed that trust is a key determinant for attitudes to EPCs, i.e., attitudes to EPCs become more positive when people trust them. However, how trust is used for the formation of attitudes depends on cognitive involvement (i.e., referring to information processing activities and the achievement of idealization states) and affective involvement (referring to feelings and achievements of certain emotional states). These two types of involvement moderate the effect of trust on attitudes to EPCs in different ways: high-cognitive involvement amplifies the effect of trust on attitudes, whereas high-affective involvement suppresses the effect of trust on attitudes. This has important theoretical implications, as both are often measured together. Equally important are the policy implications: we conclude that if trust levels are relatively high, policies focusing on increasing cognitive involvement are more likely to be effective, whereas if trust in EPCs is low, policy strategies should aim to enhance affective involvement.},

At the same time, the sector is regarded as one of the most cost-effective options for saving CO 2 emissions. To target this potential, the European Union introduced energy performance certificates (EPC). EPCs should provide clear information about the energy performance of buildings to building purchasers, owners and tenants. This study analyses, in how far EPCs have helped purchasers of owner-occupied dwellings in Germany to incorporate energy efficiency in their purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the effectiveness of EPCs is limited. Main reasons are first, that the certificates are not helpful for understanding the financial implications of energy efficiency. Second, EPCs are not viewed for most buildings due to their legal status. Third, energy efficiency is only a minor purchasing criterion for dwelling purchases. The results of the study however also point to the potential of EPCs, as these barriers can be removed. From 2013 onwards the use of the EPC will be increased due to the new EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). Changes to the design of the EPC could further increase the importance of energy performance certificates and of energy efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we empirically model financial returns to energy retrofit investments for more than 3600 multifamily and commercial buildings in New York City, using a comprehensive database of energy audits and renovation work extracted from city records using a natural language processing algorithm. Based on auditor cost and savings estimates, the median internal rate of return for adopted energy conservation measures is 21\% for multifamily buildings and 25\% for office properties. Logistic regression modeling demonstrates adoption rates are higher for office buildings than multifamily, and in both cases adopter buildings tend to be larger, higher value, and less energy efficient prior to retrofit implementation. The economically significant magnitudes of returns to adopted energy conservation measures raise important questions about why many property owners choose not to adopt. As such, we discuss incentive and regulatory mechanisms that can overcome financial and informational barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures.},

We propose a taxonomy to organize all proposed strategies following the training and the test phases in text classification tasks. Based on the taxonomy, we survey the methods proposed to address the imbalanced classification. Among them, 10 commonly-used methods were evaluated in our experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, and WebKB. Using the area under the Precision–Recall Curve as the performance measure, our experimental results showed that the best decision surface was often learned by the standard SVM, not coupled with any of the proposed strategies. We believe such a negative finding will benefit both researchers and application developers in the area by focusing more on thresholding strategies.},

	abstract = {In numerous classification problems, class distribution is not balanced. For example, positive examples are rare in the fields of disease diagnosis and credit card fraud detection. General machine learning methods are known to be suboptimal for such imbalanced classification. One popular solution is to balance training data by oversampling the underrepresented (or undersampling the overrepresented) classes before applying machine learning algorithms. However, despite its popularity, the effectiveness of sampling has not been rigorously and comprehensively evaluated. This study assessed combinations of seven sampling methods and eight machine learning classifiers (56 varieties in total) using 31 datasets with varying degrees of imbalance. We used the areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) as the performance measures. The AUPRC is known to be more informative for imbalanced classification than the AUROC. We observed that sampling significantly changed the performance of the classifier (paired t-tests P {\textless} 0.05) only for few cases (12.2\% in AUPRC and 10.0\% in AUROC). Surprisingly, sampling was more likely to reduce rather than improve the classification performance. Moreover, the adverse effects of sampling were more pronounced in AUPRC than in AUROC. Among the sampling methods, undersampling performed worse than others. Also, sampling was more effective for improving linear classifiers. Most importantly, we did not need sampling to obtain the optimal classifier for most of the 31 datasets. In addition, we found two interesting examples in which sampling significantly reduced AUPRC while significantly improving AUROC (paired t-tests P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, the applicability of sampling is limited because it could be ineffective or even harmful. Furthermore, the choice of the performance measure is crucial for decision making. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect and characteristics of sampling for imbalanced classification.},

While EPC have become a core source of information about building energy, the domains of its applications have not been studied systematically. This partly explains the limitation of conventional EPC data quality studies that fail to expose the essential problems and secure effective use of the data. This study reviews existing applications of EPC data and proposes a new method for assessing the quality of EPCs using data analytics. Thirteen application domains were identified from systematic mapping of 79 papers, revealing increases in the number and complexity of studies and advances in applied data analysis techniques. The proposed data quality assurance method based on six validation levels was tested using four samples of EPC dataset for the case of Sweden. The analysis showed that EPC data can be improved through adding or revising the EPC features and assuring interoperability of EPC datasets. In conclusion, EPC data have wider applications than initially intended by the EPC policy instrument, placing stronger requirements on the quality and content of the data.},

We find that homeowners are responsive to the upfront costs of the renovation projects, government-offered rebates, savings in energy expenses, time horizon over which such savings would be realized, and thermal comfort improvement. The implicit discount rate is low, ranging from 1.5 to 3\%, depending on model specification. This is consistent with Hassett and Metcalf (1993) and Metcalf and Rosenthal (1995), and with the fact that our scenarios contain no uncertainty. Respondents who feel completely uncertain about future energy prices are more likely to select the status quo (no renovations) in any given choice task and weight the costs of the investments more heavily than the financial gains (subsidies and savings on the energy bills). Renovations are more likely when respondents believe that climate change considerations are important determinants of home renovations.},

This situation calls for a significant effort among the scientific community to come up with engaging and meaningful visualizations and accessible scenario simulation engines. The present paper gives a contribution in this direction by providing general methods to evaluate accessibility in cities based on public transportation data. Through the notion of isochrones, the accessibility quantities proposed measure the performance of transport systems at connecting places and people in urban systems. Then we introduce scores ranking cities according to their overall accessibility. We highlight significant inequalities in the distribution of these measures across the population, which are found to be strikingly similar across various urban environments. Our results are released through the interactive platform: www.citychrone.org, aimed at providing the community at large with a useful tool for awareness and decision-making.},

This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating whether the mandatory energy efficiency ratings for residential properties imply benefits that go beyond energy savings. Using a sample of several thousand apartment transactions from Helsinki, Finland, we first test if higher ratings were significantly associated with higher prices. In addition to a large number of property and neighbourhood characteristics, this dataset contains information on building-level energy usage which allows us to distinguish between the cost savings effect of energy consumption and the value of more intangible factors associated with the energy label. The hedonic model yields a statistically significant 3.3\% price premium for apartments in the top three energy-efficiency categories and 1.5\% when a set of detailed neighbourhood characteristics are included. When maintenance costs containing energy usage costs are added, a robust and significant price premium of 1.3\% persists whereas no differentiation is found for the medium and lower rating categories. These findings may be indicative of energy-efficient buildings having signalling value – and therefore an additional incentive to invest in such buildings – for ‘green’ consumers. However, a favourable energy rating did not appear to speed up the sales process in the analysed market.},

One of these strands focuses on the role played by building energy features in shaping property prices. Indeed, market players are expected to show a higher willingness to pay for building units characterized by higher energy performance. The study of the so-called price premium for building energy efficiency has flourished in the last decade or so; plenty of evidence is now available concerning its occurrence, although its magnitude is still debated. The literature relies on the methodological frameworks of statistical modeling and multiple regression, primarily employing hedonic price models. Lately, spatial autoregressive models have also been adopted. Here, we propose to deal with estimation of the price premium by adopting an innovative perspective. In particular, we use a methodological framework in which regression models are complemented with a multi-criteria optimization approach. Using a spatial autoregressive model first, and with D as the reference energy rating band, we find the following price premiums: 55\% for A4, 42\% for A3 to A, 20\% for B or C, −14\% for F, and −29\% for G. The multi-criteria optimization approach proves efficient in estimating the price premium. The estimates above are essentially confirmed: the results converge for all the energy rating bands except for G.},

	abstract = {Energy performance remains a debated topic in real estate, particularly with reference to the capitalisation effect with property value. An emerging corpus of research studies have investigated the relationship between energy performance characteristics and the role of Energy Performance Certificates. Whilst these studies have consistently demonstrated that a pricing effect exists, some recent studies have shown that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are more complex and inconclusive, particularly when accounting for data limitations and changing model specifications. Moreover, a majority of these studies neglect to adequately account for absolute location and therefore, arguably, do not examine the geographic variation between EPCs and property value across the housing market setting. This study presents one of the first spatial analyses of EPCs using transactions for the Belfast Metropolitan Area. In evaluating whether spatial effects exist between EPCs and house prices, a number of spatial tests are performed and a series of models are developed to account for spatial dependency and determine whether there are any spatially correlating effects. The findings indicate that EPCs comprise a partial effect on house prices, and importantly, there are pricing differentials in the spatial variation in EPCs with the pricing effects conforming to both spatial clustering and randomness.},

Nevertheless, the joint effect produced by the building energy performance and the architectural, typological, and physical-technical attributes seems poorly studied. Thus, the aim of this work is to investigate the influence of both energy performance and diverse features on property prices, by performing spatial analyses on a sample of housing properties listed on Turin’s real estate market and on different sub-samples. In particular, Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses (ESDA) statistics, standard hedonic price models (Ordinary Least Squares—OLS) and Spatial Error Models (SEM) are firstly applied on the whole data sample, and then on three different sub-samples: two territorial clusters and a sub-sample representative of the most energy inefficient buildings constructed between 1946 and 1990. Results demonstrate that Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) labels are gaining power in influencing price variations, contrary to the empirical evidence that emerged in some previous studies. Furthermore, the presence of the spatial effects reveals that the impact of energy attributes changes in different sub-markets and thus has to be spatially analysed.},

They play a central role in the context of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) which asks member states (MS) to take the necessary measures to establish a complete certification system. In this study, an application of the hedonic price method (HPM) assessing the effect of energy labels derived from the EPC on real estate market value is presented. The estimation methodology was applied to two European cities characterized by different climate conditions. The analysis was based on two datasets of listing prices referring to multi-family residential markets in Turin (Italy) and Barcelona (Spain). Four models for each dataset were applied to capture the marginal price of green attributes, but also to control for the spatial autocorrelation among values. The findings showed how the EPC has been applied in the two countries and how it has influenced the real estate market. Turin’s buyers pay more attention to the EPC label, while in Barcelona, they value much more single characteristics, such as air conditioning and a swimming pool, considered popular attributes among contemporary buildings in this climate zone. From the results, it is possible to deduce that the implementation of the EPC schemes is still irregular in EU countries and must be strengthened through a standardized rating model.},

	abstract = {All European Union Member States require an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) when buildings are constructed, sold and rented. At its introduction the EPC was considered a pioneering instrument, one that would help overcome an information deficit hindering consumer interest in energy efficient dwellings. Now that the EPC has been implemented for several years it is possible to examine its impact. This research draws on data from ex-ante and ex-post assessments of the EPC in a number of countries and presents the results of a survey of Dutch private dwelling purchasers. This survey was based on two sample populations, one received an EPC during property transaction and another did not. Differences were sought between the two samples in a number of areas relating to the adoption of energy efficiency measures. Results show that many projections about the impact of the EPC have fallen short. The EPC was found to have a weak influence, especially pre-purchase. The potential of the EPC in driving energy efficiency improvement in the existing stock is doubted especially if it continues to act independent from a mix of instruments designed to tackle multiple barriers. It is argued that the energy saving potential of existing dwellings, applauded in climate change policy, will remain unexploited if it continues to be assessed subjectively by householders.},

Danish homeowners’ experiences with the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) are examined, as it was introduced in 1997 (prior to a similar scheme introduced later in the European Union). The main research question is whether the EPC has an influence on Danish homeowners’ energy retrofit practices. Homeowners’ understanding of and trust in the EPC are analyzed, based on an online survey of homeowners (N = 743) living in a home with a recently issued EPC. Results indicate that the EPC has a limited influence on homeowners’ energy retrofit practices. Despite most homeowners finding the EPC reliable and easy to understand, relatively few find it useful as a source of information for home retrofits. In its current form, the EPC is insufficient to encourage homeowners to undertake energy retrofits of their home. Improvements to address this problem in the administration, scope and layout of the EPC are suggested.},

Imbalanced data raises problems in Machine Learning classification and predicting an outcome becomes difficult when there is not enough data to learn from. The object of classification in our study is data coming from the field of Human Resources, consisting of short descriptions of work experiences which must be classified into several highly imbalanced classes expressing job types. We perform an extensive experimental analysis using various representations of text data, several classification algorithms and balancing schemes to derive a model that achieves highest performance with respect to metrics such as precision and recall. The contribution is twofold: a) with a comprehensive experimental design, the analysis is focused on studying the interactions between classification algorithms, text vectorization choices and the schemes to deal with data imbalance at several degrees of imbalance; b) besides state-of-the-art balancing schemes, we propose and analyze a cost sensitive approach formulated as a numerical optimization problem where the costs are derived with a Differential Evolution algorithm in two steps: in a first step costs are optimized at the class level and in a subsequent step costs are refined at the data instance level. The results indicate that the use of cost-sensitive classifiers where the cost matrices are optimized with a Differential Evolution algorithm brings important benefits on our real-world problem.},

The classes are then classified by determining the text types of the content. Based on different machine learning algorithms used in the current paper, the system of text classification is divided into four sections namely text pre-treatment, text representation, implementation of the classifier and classification. In this paper, a BBC news text classification system is designed. In the classifier implementation section, the authors separately chose and compared logistic regression, random forest and K-nearest neighbour as our classification algorithms. Then, these classifiers were tested, analysed and compared with each other and finally got a conclusion. The experimental conclusion shows that BBC news text classification model gets satisfying results on the basis of algorithms tested on the data set. The authors decided to show the comparison based on five parameters namely precision, accuracy, F1-score, support and confusion matrix. The classifier which gets the highest among all these parameters is termed as the best machine learning algorithm for the BBC news data set.},

In this paper, we conduct a comparative study on the effectiveness of these strategies in the context of imbalanced text classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. SVM is the interest in this study for its good classification accuracy reported in many text classification tasks. We propose a taxonomy to organize all proposed strategies following the training and the test phases in text classification tasks. Based on the taxonomy, we survey the methods proposed to address the imbalanced classification. Among them, 10 commonly-used methods were evaluated in our experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, and WebKB. Using the area under the Precision–Recall Curve as the performance measure, our experimental results showed that the best decision surface was often learned by the standard SVM, not coupled with any of the proposed strategies. We believe such a negative finding will benefit both researchers and application developers in the area by focusing more on thresholding strategies.},

Due to the minimal to no feature engineering required when using these models, PLMs are becoming the de facto choice for any NLP task. However, for domain-specific corpora (e.g., financial, legal, and industrial), fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task has shown to provide a performance improvement. In this paper, we compare the performance of four different PLMs on three public domain-free datasets and a real-world dataset containing domain-specific words, against a simple SVM linear classifier with TFIDF vectorized text. The experimental results on the four datasets show that using PLMs, even fine-tuned, do not provide significant gain over the linear SVM classifier. Hence, we recommend that for text classification tasks, traditional SVM along with careful feature engineering can pro-vide a cheaper and superior performance than PLMs.},
